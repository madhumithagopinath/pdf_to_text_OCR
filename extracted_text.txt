ABSTRACT

¢Food wastage is a critical global issue, with over 1.3 billion tons of food lost every year due to
poor tracking. Traditional refrigerators are passive and lack intelligence to monitor or manage
stored items efficiently. This contributes to unplanned spoilage, unnecessary purchases, and
increased energy use.

eThis project introduces a smart refrigerator system powered by Al, ML, and loT technologies.
It uses computer vision to identify food items, OCR to extract expiry dates from barcodes, and
reinforcement learning to adjust cooling dynamically. Real-time data is synced to a mobile app,
enabling remote access and timely alerts.

eOur proposed system significantly enhances user convenience while supporting sustainable
living. It empowers users to keep track of inventory, avoid waste, and receive intelligent grocery
suggestions. Energy efficiency is improved through smart temperature regulation based on food
type and quantity.

eThe integration of Al with cloud and mobile technologies creates a seamless smart kitchen
ecosystem. Users gain complete visibility and control over stored food items, even when away
from home. This system sets the foundation for future innovations in home automation, food
safety, and energy conservation.

INTRODUCTION

eln a world that’s getting smarter, the kitchen still struggles with one outdated habit: forgetting
what’s in the fridge until it’s too late.

eOver 1.3 billion tons of food is wasted globally each year, much of it from household refrigerators
due to lack of visibility and tracking.

eTraditional refrigerators are passive systems—they cannot detect items, track expiry dates, or
regulate temperature intelligently.

¢ Artificial Intelligence (Al) and the Internet of Things (loT) are transforming how we interact with
home appliances by enabling automation and data-driven control.

eA smart refrigerator can recognize stored food, monitor freshness, and automatically adjust
cooling based on real-time conditions.

eThis project proposes a solution that combines Al, machine learning, and loT to make food storage
smarter, more efficient, and more sustainable.

PROPOSED METHODOLOGY

¢Food Detection & Expiry Tracking:

Sensor cameras and barcode scanners capture images and product details. Al (YOLO, Faster R-CNN)
detects food items, while OCR extracts expiry dates from labels.

eIntelligent Data Processing:

Machine learning models analyze inventory patterns and predict spoilage risks, enabling proactive
food management.

¢ Dynamic Cooling Control:

A reinforcement learning algorithm (DQN) adjusts the refrigerator’s temperature based on food type,
quantity, and freshness, improving energy efficiency.

eCloud & Mobile Integration:

lol modules sync data to cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Firebase), allowing users to monitor and control
the refrigerator remotely via a mobile app and voice assistants.

RESULT

eThe smart refrigerator successfully detects and classifies various food items using deep
learning-based computer vision models, providing consistent accuracy in real-world kitchen
environments.

eExpiry dates are accurately extracted from barcodes and labels using OCR, with over 90%
success in well-lit conditions, reducing manual tracking by users.

eThe reinforcement learning model dynamically adjusts the internal cooling based on food
type, quantity, and freshness, achieving up to 18% reduction in energy consumption
compared to traditional methods.

eUsers benefit from real-time inventory updates, expiry alerts, and remote temperature
control through an integrated mobile application, improving daily convenience.

*Overall, the system proves effective in minimizing food waste, enhancing energy efficiency,
and supporting sustainable kitchen automation through Al and lIoT integration.
